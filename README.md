# Financial-Crimes-Enforcement-Network-FinCEN
This project is to propose a problem that can be solved by undergoing the data science process.

# Introduction
FinCEN refers to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, it is a bureau of the United States Department of the Treasury that collects and analyzes information about financial transactions in order to combat domestic and international money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes. We are provided two dataset call transactions map: 4,508 rows and bank connections: 5,499 rows to perform the project analysis. Meanwhile, we also collected 2 extra datasets (countries of the world and Income Group) to support our project outcome.

# Problem & Motivation
The problem that we found and intend to solve from this dataset is the contributing factors of suspicious transactions. The motivation behind this problem is the incident of the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) scandal that occurred in Malaysia in 2015. 1MDB is a Malaysian state fund which was established in 2009 to promote development through foreign investment and partnerships. The fund was one of the biggest corruption scandals in the world where the US justice department believes that the scandal is more than 4.5 billion US dollars. Into the details, vast sums were borrowed via government bonds and then siphoned into bank accounts in Switzerland, Singapore, and United States. Therefore, we would like to know what factors will make a transaction suspicious and explore their relationships as well as building model to tackle this problem. 

# Questions
`Descriptive:`
1. What are the number of transactions, amount of transactions, and the average amount of
transactions for each countries?
2. Which countries contributes to the majority of suspicious transactions?
3. What are the number of transactions, amount of transactions, and the average amount of
transactions for each region?
4. Which regions contributes to majority of suspicious transactions?

`Exploratory:`
1. What kind of relationships are there between the attributes?

`Predictive:`
1. Can we predict if a transaction is suspicious based on its attributes?


# Benefits of this study
This project albe to be involved in the entire process from figuring out the problem and question you intend to ask, understand, collect data, perform cleaning/pre-processing, explore the data, build data-driven models and visualize the data meaningfully. The data science process also involves the ability to pitch your problem and to convey the message convincingly to the target audience.
